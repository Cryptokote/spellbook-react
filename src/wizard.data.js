The caltrops make one attack roll (+0 melee) against the creature. For this attack, the target 's shield and deflection bonuses do not count, nor does its armor bonus for armor worn. A target wearing shoes or other footwear gains a +2 armor bonus to Armor Class (which does count). If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the creature has stepped on one.\nA successful attack by a caltrop deals 1 point of damage. If the target is Small, Medium, or Large, its land speed is reduced by one half because of the injury. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.\nThe DM judges the effectiveness of caltrops against unusual opponents or opponents outside the size range given above. A giant centipede, for example, can scramble among the caltrops with no chance of hurting itself, and a fire giant wearing thick, massive boots might be immune to their attacks.\nFor every two caster levels beyond 1st, you can affect an additional 5-foot-by-5-foot square, and the caltrops' attack bonus increases by 1.

Each touch spell you cast resides in a different forelimb. For the duration of this spell, any touch spells you cast are discharged only if you cast another spell with that forelimb or touch something with that forelimb.\nFor example, a human sorcerer casts this spell, then casts chill touch and holds the charge in his left hand, then casts shocking grasp and holds the charge in his right hand. Because of the spell flower, he can hold the charge on both of these spells at the same time. If he casts another spell with a somatic component (which requires the use of one of his hands), he immediately loses one of his held touch spells (his choice), but if the spell he casts is also a touch spell, he can immediately hold the charge in the available hand. If he chooses to attack with a touch spell, it works normally. Since he has multiple limbs that are considered armed, he can make an off-hand attack with the other touch spell in the same round, with the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons (PH 160).\nA marilith spellcaster could do the same as the sorcerer in the previous example, except that she could hold the charge on up to six touch spells.

You can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.\nNote: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. Thus, you can't use dispel magic to repair damage caused by a fireball or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.\nYou choose to use dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:\nTargeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.\nFor example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets dispel magic on a drow who is under the effects of haste, mage armor, and bull's strength. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the haste, mage armor, and bull's strength effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.\nIf you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.\nIf the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\nYou automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.\nArea Dispel: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.\nFor each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.\nFor each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures.

No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. (You choose which creatures are released). If you are a cleric, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit.\nSkeletons: A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones, so creating a skeleton from a purple worm, for example, is not possible. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. The statistics for a skeleton depend on its size; they do not depend on what abilities the creature may have had while alive. The Monster Manual has game statistics for skeletons.\nZombies: A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a true anatomy, so a dead gelatinous cube, for example, cannot be animated as a zombie. The statistics for a zombie depend on its size, not on what abilities the creature may have had while alive. The Monster Manual has game statistics for zombies.\nMaterial Component: You must place a black onyx gem worth at least 25 gp per Hit Die of the undead into the mouth or eye socket of each corpse you intend to animate. The magic of the spell turns these gems into worthless, burned-out shells.\n", components: ['V', 'S', 'M'] },

a roiling black cloud of demonic essence out of the demon and channel it into the willing recipient.You transfer a portion of a demon's essence into a willing creature, enhancing one of its ability scores or skills.The demon must be either allied and willing or captured and constrained (as if by a planar binding spell).An unwilling demon can make a Will save to negate the effects of the spell.Both the recipient and the donor demon must remain within specially prepared circles inscribed on the floor for the entire casting time.These circles are similar to summoning circles and can be integrated into a summoning circle without impacting the function of either spell, but neither the demon nor the recipient need be summoned specifically into the circle for this spell's circle\xe2\x80\x94each needs only to stand within it during the casting.The benefit granted by this spell can be applied to one of the recipient's ability scores (as an enhancement bonus) or to one of his skills (as a competence bonus), as you designate.Once this decision is made, it cannot be changed, and the effect cannot be dispelled except by a caster of higher level than you were when you cast the spell.If you wish, you can increase the save DC for this spell by allowing the demon power over the target.The specific concessions you can make to the demon and the corresponding increases to the save DC are given below.+1 Increase: The donor demon can track the recipient's location and condition, effectively gaining the effect of a constant status spell on it.+3 Increase: The demon can see through the recipient's eyes and hear through its ears.+5 Increase: The demon can telepathically communicate with the recipient as if by Rary's telepathic bond.+7 Increase: The demon can use demand on the recipient once per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equals your caster level at the time you cast extract gift).The effects of the concessions are cumulative, but the save DC increases do not stack.Thus, allowing the demon to track the recipient, use its senses, and communicate with it telepathically would increase the save DC by 5.Increasing the save DC in this manner is an evil act, since it grants the demon more than the usual opportunity to work its evil.Thus, using this option adds the evil descriptor to the spell.Ability Bonus: The recipient gains an enhancement bonus to one ability score of your choice.The value of this bonus depends on your caster level and the abilities of the donor demon, as given below.The maximum value of the bonus you can grant is one-fourth of your caster level (rounded down).Thus, you could grant the recipient up to a +2 enhancement bonus at 9th level, or up to a +5 bonus at 20th level.You can always choose to grant a bonus lower than your maximum.The donor demon's ability modifier for the corresponding score must be at least twice that of the granted bonus.Thus, to grant a +2 bonus to Dexterity, you must extract essence from a demon with a Dexterity score of at least 18 (such as a marilith).To grant a +5 bonus to Charisma, you need a demon with a Charisma score of at least 30 (such as a lilitu).Skill Bonus: The recipient gains a competence bonus on checks made with one skill of your choice.The value of this bonus depends on your caster level and the abilities of the donor demon, as given below.The maximum value of the bonus you can grant is one-half your caster level (rounded down).Thus, you could grant the recipient up to a +4 enhancement bonus at 9th level, or up to a +10 bonus at 20th level.You can always choose to grant a bonus lower than your maximum.The donor demon's ranks in the selected skill must be at least twice the granted bonus.Thus, to grant a +5 bonus on Disable Device checks, you must extract essence from a demon with at least 10 ranks in Disable Device (such as a babau).To grant a +10 bonus on Bluff checks, you need a demon with at least 20 ranks in Bluff (such as a balor).Material Component: The circles in which the donor and recipient stand during the casting must be inscribed with expensive paints made from powdered diamonds, cold iron, blood, and various rare and exotic pigments.Each circle must also be decorated with five flawless sapphires, which serve as conduits between the donor demon and the recipient.The total cost of these pigments and gems depends on the nature and magnitude of the bonus to be imparted.For an ability bonus, the cost equals the bonus squared times 1,000 gp (1,000 gp for +1, 4,000 gp for +2, 9,000 gp for +3, 16,000 gp for +4, and 25,000 gp for +5).For a skill bonus, the cost equals the bonus squared times 100 gp (100 gp for +1, 400 gp for +2, 900 gp for +3, 1,600 gp for +4, 2,500 gp for +5, 3,600 gp for +6, 4,900 gp for +7, 6,400 gp

Even objects in a bag of holding can be stolen. It can steal objects, bring objects to you, or put them back where they came from. It can take no other actions. A phantasmal thief needs 1 round to steal an object and another round to bring it to you.\nA phantasmal thief can hold only one object at a time, and the object becomes invisible in its grasp. A thief cannot take an item if it is detected by the creature it's trying to steal from (with a Listen or Spot check). However, the thief can repeat the attempt in the next round. It cannot be harmed in any way, although it can be dispelled.\nA phantasmal thief can steal an object from a creature's hand by making a successful disarm attempt. It does so with a bonus on the disarm check equal to your caster level.

These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions.\nWhile the individual eyes are quite fragile, they\'re small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, AC 18 (+8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, and has a +16 Hide modifier. It has a Spot modifier equal to your caster level (maximum +15) and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch.\nWhen you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well, so if you know, for example, what a typical merchant looks like, the eyes do as well.\nA sample command: Surround me at a range of four hundred feet and return if you spot any dangerous creatures. The phrase Surround me directs the eyes to form an equally spaced, horizontal ring at whatever range you indicate, and then move with you. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. In the case of this sample command, an eye returns only if it spots a creature you would regard as dangerous. A peasant that is actually a shapechanged dragon wouldn\'t trigger an eye\'s return. Ten eyes can form a ring with a radius of 400 feet and between themselves see everything that crosses the ring.\nAnother sample command: Spread out and search the town for Arweth. Follow him for three minutes, staying out of sight, and then return. The phrase Spread out directs the eyes to move away from you in all directions. In this case, each eye would separately follow Arweth for three minutes once it spots him.\nOther commands that might be useful include having eyes form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or having them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of your directions.\nIn order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears.\nIf an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won\'t know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event.\nThe eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. Dispel magic can destroy eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel. Of course, if an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself.\nMaterial Component: A handful of crystal marbles.\n'", components: ['V', 'S', 'M'] },

A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.\nThis version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.\nAn object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks against a DC set by the DM.\nCombat Maneuver: Alternatively, once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn't allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.\nViolent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).\nYou must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects such as a barrel) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects such as a boulder).\nCreatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.

The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.\nAn antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. A hasted creature, for example, is not hasted while inside the field, but the spell resumes functioning when the creature leaves the field. Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell's duration. \nSummoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations, such as create water, are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result). \nA normal creature (a normally encountered griffon rather than a conjured one, for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. Dispel magic does not remove the field.\nTwo or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force, prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall, remain unaffected by antimagic field (see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.(See the Dungeon Master's Guide for more about artifacts).\nShould a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.\nArcane Material Component: A pinch of powdered iron or iron filings.\n", components: ['V', 'S', 'M', 'DF'] },

Slowly it rises from your hand, emitting a soft beam that illuminates the chosen area. Then it disappears, and you place the spell within the magic trap.\nYou create a lingering zone of transformative magic that absorbs magic energy from magic items or spellcasting and uses it to power another spell tied to that location. For example, you could have an energy transformation field tied to a summon monster V spell that would summon a monster when the field had absorbed enough magic.\nThe field absorbs the magic of spells cast, spell-like or supernatural abilities that are activated, and magic items used within its dimensions. Each source of magic provides spell levels of energy to the field equal to the spell level of the effect used. Supernatural abilities that emulate spells provide energy equal to the spell level of the effect. Super-natural abilities that do not emulate spells provide energy equal to the HD of the creature using the ability. For example, a cast fireball spell or a charge from a wand of fireball would add three spell levels to the field\'s store, a potion of cure light wounds would add one, and a wish from a ring of three wishes would add nine. Items that don\'t have a clearly defined spell level (such as the effects of most rods) use the prerequisite caster level needed to create that item (so an immovable rod would provide two spell levels every time it was activated because of its levitate prerequisite). Effects that are absorbed give no indication of where the magic went; they simply vanish.\nThe field absorbs only magic that is actually used within its area. Ongoing magical effects that enter the area, including spells cast from outside the area into the field or continually functioning items such as a +1 mace, are often visibly reduced, but do not have their actual effects hindered. For example, a continual flame would dim slightly, but its overall magic would not be affected.\nAn energy transformation field has a single spell linked to it. When the field has absorbed spell levels equal to the spell level of its linked spell, it automatically casts that spell at a point within the field designated by you at the time of the casting of the field. This expends those absorbed spell levels (although unused levels remain until they are used or expire). The cast spell functions as if cast by you in terms of duration and all level-based spell effects. Absorbed spell levels fade at a rate of one per day if not used. The field automatically triggers its linked spell if it has enough stored spell levels and the duration of its previous casting has expired. If a linked spell requires concentration to maintain, the field expends one spell level for every hour of concentration (the field\'s concentration is interrupted only by its complete destruction). Spells that require a target will target the living creature nearest to the field.\nTypical spells linked to an energy transformation field are blindness/deafness:spells/players-handbook-v35\xe2\x80\x946/blindnessdeafness\xe2\x80\x942715/, fireball, suggestion, summon monster, or wall of force. Spells that have a costly material component or an XP cost cannot be linked to a field, but those with a costly focus can if the focus object is present within the field (typically sealed into a wall or in a secret compartment).\nOnly Mordenkainen\'s disjunction, limited wish, wish, or similar spells can destroy the energy transformation field. Spells of lower level, such as dispel magic and greater dispel magic, are absorbed by it, and an antimagic field prevents it from absorbing magical energy within the field but does not otherwise hamper this spell. If two or more field spells share an overlapping area, each field has an equal chance of absorbing a spell effect in that area.\nMaterial Component: Three drops of your blood, an eye from any humanoid, and 5,000 gp worth of powdered diamond.\nXP Cost: 250 XP.\n'", components: ['V', 'S', 'M', 'XP'] },

binding spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature.The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level.You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell.For each assistant who casts suggestion, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by 1.For each assistant who casts dominate animal, dominate person, or dominate monster, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a binding spell.Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the binding spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant.Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts.All binding spells are dismissible.Regardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur.These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass.The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify.For example, a bound creature can be released when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed.Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.If you are casting any of the first three versions of binding (those with limited durations), you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap.If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw.If the creature succeeds on this save, all the binding spells it has received are broken.The binding spell has six versions.Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you.The duration is one year per caster level.The subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.Slumber: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level.The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age.This form of binding is more difficult to cast than chaining, making it slightly easier to resist.Reduce the spell's save DC by 1.Bound Slumber: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as one month per caster level.Reduce the save DC by 2.Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area (such as a labyrinth) from which it cannot wander by any means.The effect is permanent.Reduce the save DC by 3.Metamorphosis: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face.It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose.The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities.The binding is permanent.The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age.Reduce the save DC by 4.Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object.The binding is permanent.The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age.Reduce the save DC by 4.You can't dispel a binding spell with dispel magic or a similar effect, though an antimagic field or Mordenkainen's disjunction affects it normally.A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to dismissal, banishment, or a similar effect.Components: The components for a binding spell vary according to the version of the spell, but they always include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or spellbook page containing the spell, somatic gestures, and materials appropriate to the form of binding used.These components can include such items as miniature chains of special metals (silver for lycanthropes, cold iron for demons, and so forth), soporific herbs of the rarest sort (for slumber bindings), a bell jar of the finest crystal, and the like.In addition to the specially made props suited to the

A disintegrate spell slows the construct (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d12 points of damage. An earthquake spell cast directly at the construct stops it from moving on its next turn and deals 5d10 points of damage. The construct gets no saving throw against any of these effects.\nAny magical attack against the construct that deals acid damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The construct gets no saving throw against magical attacks that deal acid damage.\nFlesh: A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows the construct (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals electricity damage breaks any slow effect on the construct and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The construct gets no saving throw against attacks that deal electricity damage.\nIron: A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows the construct (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the construct and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The construct gets no saving throw against fire effects. The construct is affected as an iron construct by rust attacks, such as that of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell, regardless of its original composition.\nStone: A transmute rock to mud spell slows the construct (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock acts as a total repair spell. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the construct's structure but negates its immunity to magic for 1 full round.\n", components: ['V', 'S'] },

reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune.Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can\'t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune).Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death\'s triggering conditions cannot be changed.In this case, reading the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning.Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch.You can\'t use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature.Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.You can also set special triggering limitations of your own.These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire.Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature\'s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don\'t qualify.For example, a symbol of death can be set to activate when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect.Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune\'s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune.If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time.Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour.Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours.Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees fit.Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered.You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.Read magic allows you to identify a symbol of death with a DC 19 Spellcraft check.Of course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune.An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death.Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.Symbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell.A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.Note:Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable.A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of death and Disable Device to thwart it.The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for symbol of death.Material Component:Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 5,000 gp each.\n'", components: ['V', 'S', 'M'] },

Touch spells, effect spells, and area spells that affect you cannot be absorbed. Once the spell is cast, you can absorb 1d4+6 spell levels (rolled secretly by the DM). The level of each spell you absorb is subtracted from the total. If a spell is only partially absorbed (because its level exceeds the number of levels remaining to be absorbed), divide the number of spell levels left unabsorbed by the original spell level. For spells that deal damage, use the result to determine what fraction of the damage you take. For spells that create effects, use the result as a percentage chance to be affected.\nFor example, you have three spell levels of absorption remaining and are struck by dominate person (cast as a 5th-level spell). Absorption absorbs three levels of the spell, resulting in a 40% chance (2/5) that you will be affected normally. \nIf affected, any saving throw the spell allows you still applies. Likewise, if you're struck by disintegrate (cast as a 6th-level spell) with four levels of absorption remaining, two levels of the spell remain, and you take only 33% (2/6) of the damage you would normally take from the spell. You can use captured spell energy to cast any spell you know or have prepared, but spells so cast don't disappear from your list of prepared spells or count against the number of spells you can normally cast per day (so you so must keep a running total of spell levels absorbed and used).\nThe levels of spell energy you have stored must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell you want to cast, and you must have at hand (and expend) any material components required for the spell.\n", components: ['V', 'S'] },

First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.\nSecond, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the gate. The gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster\'s choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.\nA gate has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.\nPlanar Travel: As a mode of planar travel, a gate spell functions much like a plane shift spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you\xe2\x80\x94anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.\nYou could position a gate in a hallway in order to absorb any attack or force coming at you by shunting it to another plane. Whether the denizens of that plane appreciate this tactic is, of course, another matter.\nYou may hold the gate open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.\nCalling Creatures: The second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).\nIf you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual\xe2\x80\x94for instance, a bearded devil or a ghaele eladrin\xe2\x80\x94you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can\'t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.\nA controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature\'s help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.\nIf you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in livestock rather than in coin, which could involve complications). Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.\nFailure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.\nNote: When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type. For example, gate is a chaotic and evil spell when you cast it to call a demon.\nXP Cost: 1,000 XP (only for the calling creatures function).\n'", components: ['V', 'S', 'XP'] },

Two to five wish spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. Note: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.\nRemove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same wish. A wish can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.\nRevive the dead. A wish can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A wish can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two wish, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A wish cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level.\nTransport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.\nUndo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent event. The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish could undo an opponent\'s successful save, a foe\'s successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend\'s failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.\n\nYou may try to use a wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. Such a wish gives the DM the opportunity to fulfil your request without fulfilling it completely. (The wish may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment). For example, wishing for a staff of the magi might get you instantly transported to the presence of the staff\'s current owner. Wishing to be immortal could get you imprisoned in a hidden extradimensional space (as by an imprisonment spell), where you could live indefinitely.\nDuplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells).\nMaterial Component: When a wish duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component.\nXP Cost: The minimum XP cost for casting wish is 5,000 XP. When a wish duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is more. When a wish creates or improves a magic item, you must pay twice the normal XP cost for crafting or improving the item, plus an additional 5,000 XP.\n'", components: ['V', 'XP'] }];
