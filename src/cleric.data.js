It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.\nFirst, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.\nSecond, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as dominate person). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.\nThird, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.\nArcane Material Component: A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-foot -diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.\n'", components: ['V', 'S', 'M', 'DF'] },

The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats (such as Weapon Focus) or combat actions (such as charge) do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. \nEach round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round\'s target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spell\'s range, not the weapon\'s normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.\nA spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A spiritual weapon\'s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object). \nIf an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.\nThe weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity\'s own personal weapon, many of which have individual names.

You can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.\nNote: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. Thus, you can't use dispel magic to repair damage caused by a fireball or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.\nYou choose to use dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:\nTargeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.\nFor example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets dispel magic on a drow who is under the effects of haste, mage armor, and bull's strength. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the haste, mage armor, and bull's strength effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.\nIf you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.\nIf the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\nYou automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.\nArea Dispel: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.\nFor each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.\nFor each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.\nFor each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.\nFor each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.\nIf an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.\nYou may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.\nCounterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.\n", components: ['V', 'S'] },

This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.\nA task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to one day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD. \nA nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, the DM may halve or even waive the payment. For instance, a celestial creature called to battle demons might require a gift of only half the normal value.\nAt the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).\nNote:When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.

scores or skills.The demon must be either allied and willing or captured and constrained (as if by a planar binding spell).An unwilling demon can make a Will save to negate the effects of the spell.Both the recipient and the donor demon must remain within specially prepared circles inscribed on the floor for the entire casting time.These circles are similar to summoning circles and can be integrated into a summoning circle without impacting the function of either spell, but neither the demon nor the recipient need be summoned specifically into the circle for this spell's circle\xe2\x80\x94each needs only to stand within it during the casting.The benefit granted by this spell can be applied to one of the recipient's ability scores (as an enhancement bonus) or to one of his skills (as a competence bonus), as you designate.Once this decision is made, it cannot be changed, and the effect cannot be dispelled except by a caster of higher level than you were when you cast the spell.If you wish, you can increase the save DC for this spell by allowing the demon power over the target.The specific concessions you can make to the demon and the corresponding increases to the save DC are given below.+1 Increase: The donor demon can track the recipient's location and condition, effectively gaining the effect of a constant status spell on it.+3 Increase: The demon can see through the recipient's eyes and hear through its ears.+5 Increase: The demon can telepathically communicate with the recipient as if by Rary's telepathic bond.+7 Increase: The demon can use demand on the recipient once per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equals your caster level at the time you cast extract gift).The effects of the concessions are cumulative, but the save DC increases do not stack.Thus, allowing the demon to track the recipient, use its senses, and communicate with it telepathically would increase the save DC by 5.Increasing the save DC in this manner is an evil act, since it grants the demon more than the usual opportunity to work its evil.Thus, using this option adds the evil descriptor to the spell.Ability Bonus: The recipient gains an enhancement bonus to one ability score of your choice.The value of this bonus depends on your caster level and the abilities of the donor demon, as given below.The maximum value of the bonus you can grant is one-fourth of your caster level (rounded down).Thus, you could grant the recipient up to a +2 enhancement bonus at 9th level, or up to a +5 bonus at 20th level.You can always choose to grant a bonus lower than your maximum.The donor demon's ability modifier for the corresponding score must be at least twice that of the granted bonus.Thus, to grant a +2 bonus to Dexterity, you must extract essence from a demon with a Dexterity score of at least 18 (such as a marilith).To grant a +5 bonus to Charisma, you need a demon with a Charisma score of at least 30 (such as a lilitu).Skill Bonus: The recipient gains a competence bonus on checks made with one skill of your choice.The value of this bonus depends on your caster level and the abilities of the donor demon, as given below.The maximum value of the bonus you can grant is one-half your caster level (rounded down).Thus, you could grant the recipient up to a +4 enhancement bonus at 9th level, or up to a +10 bonus at 20th level.You can always choose to grant a bonus lower than your maximum.The donor demon's ranks in the selected skill must be at least twice the granted bonus.Thus, to grant a +5 bonus on Disable Device checks, you must extract essence from a demon with at least 10 ranks in Disable Device (such as a babau).To grant a +10 bonus on Bluff checks, you need a demon with at least 20 ranks in Bluff (such as a balor).Material Component: The circles in which the donor and recipient stand during the casting must be inscribed with expensive paints made from powdered diamonds, cold iron, blood, and various rare and exotic pigments.Each circle must also be decorated with five flawless sapphires, which serve as conduits between the donor demon and the recipient.The total cost of these pigments and gems depends on the nature and magnitude of the bonus to be imparted.For an ability bonus, the cost equals the bonus squared times 1,000 gp (1,000 gp for +1, 4,000 gp for +2, 9,000 gp for +3, 16,000 gp for +4, and 25,000

soundly secured is pushed violently to the outer edge of the area.If this forces the creature or object into a solid surface, it takes 8d6 points of damage.A creature holding onto a sturdy object can make a DC 20 Strength check to avoid being moved.A creature not already holding onto such an object can make a DC 20 Reflex save or Swim check to grab one.A creature of Huge size or larger can make a DC 30 Strength check to dig in its feet and simply withstand the oncoming wave.A creature that fails any of these checks falls prone in addition to being swept away.The specific effect and aftereffects of a flashflood spell on the environment depend on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.When the spell is completed, a total volume of 100,000 cubic feet of water (400 5-foot squares, in a 120-ft. cone, 10 feet deep) is left behind.This water behaves like ordinary water\xe2\x80\x94draining away and leaving puddles in most cases, or perhaps forming a shallow lake or pond.Unless the caster has taken care to create the flashflood in a cleared area, however, the water left behind is full of debris, dirt, and perhaps a few corpses.Such water is unfit to drink.Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The sudden surge of water knocks down support beams, but otherwise has no real effect, aside from filling the tunnel with water to a depth of 10 feet.If the area is insufficient to support 100,000 cubic feet of water, the water level rises above 10 feet until the entire volume is filled, or it spills outward from the confines of the original 400 squares.What happens is based on the layout of the area.In the case of level terrain, the water simply drains away over the course of a minute or so, leaving pools in depressions from which it cannot drain.When the ground in a tunnel is not level, the water might flood sections of the tunnel.In such cases, determine whether the flooded area is sufficient to contain the entire volume of water created\xe2\x80\x94and, if not, how deeply the water floods the next level up.Any creatures caught in water over their heads might drown.For example, Miyish casts flashflood in the dungeon of a ruined castle.The dungeon's total volume is only 40,000 cubic feet (160 squares, with a 10-foot ceiling).The remaining 60,000 cubic feet of water has to go somewhere, so it rushes up and out the entrance to the dungeon.Since the terrain above the dungeon is another level of the castle, and is basically watertight, the water collects up here.The total volume of this level is 80,000 cubic feet (320 squares, with a 10-foot ceiling), leaving 20,000 cubic feet of air.Since the water has nowhere to go but up, and it has gone as high as it can, the water on this level is 7-1/2 feet deep (60,000 cubic feet divided by 8,000\xe2\x80\x94the square footage of 320 5-foot squares).If Miyish can't swim or breathe water, he has made a grave tactical error by casting flashflood in an area too small to contain it.Cliffs: Casting flashflood at the base of a cliff has no effect on the cliff.Casting flashflood from the top of a cliff can force creatures and objects over the edge, so that they take falling damage.Open Ground: Creatures on open ground are safest from the worst effects of flashflood.They might be knocked prone by the force of the water, or even swept 120 feet (24 squares) away, but they are not in any particular danger of drowning or being crushed.Structure(s): Any structure standing on open ground takes 60 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden building, but not a structure built of stone, masonry, or reinforced masonry.Hardness reduces this damage, but it isn't halved as damage dealt to objects normally is.Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half).The debris is swept away by the flashflood.River, Lake, or Marsh: The river, lake, or marsh overflows its banks, though with rivers the effect is transitory.In the case of lakes and marshes, determine how much the body of water overflows, given the 100,000 cubic feet of water added to it.Only calculate this amount if the total surface area of the lake or marsh is less than 40,000 square feet\xe2\x80\x94and even then, it's only academic unless it is important to determine whether something on the shore gets wet.\n", components: ['V', 'S',

for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature.Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.You can also set special triggering limitations of your own.These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire.Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature\'s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don\'t qualify.For example, a symbol of death can be set to activate when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect.Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune\'s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune.If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time.Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour.Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours.Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees fit.Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered.You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.Read magic allows you to identify a symbol of death with a DC 19 Spellcraft check.Of course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune.An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death.Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.Symbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell.A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.Note:Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable.A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of death and Disable Device to thwart it.The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for symbol of death.Material Component:Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 5,000 gp each.\n'", components: ['V', 'S', 'M'] },

Whether the denizens of that plane appreciate this tactic is, of course, another matter.\nYou may hold the gate open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.\nCalling Creatures: The second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).\nIf you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual\xe2\x80\x94for instance, a bearded devil or a ghaele eladrin\xe2\x80\x94you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can\'t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.\nA controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature\'s help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.\nIf you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in livestock rather than in coin, which could involve complications). Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.\nFailure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.\nNote: When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type. For example, gate is a chaotic and evil spell when you cast it to call a demon.\nXP Cost: 1,000 XP (only for the calling creatures function).\n'", components: ['V', 'S', 'XP'] },
